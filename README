Closet Counter is a browser based application for tracking inventory for non-profit, non-monetary transaction clothes/goods providing organizations.  In other words, it keeps track of in-coming and out-going donations for "Salvation Army/Goodwill" like organizations who do not need to track associated financials when providing clothes and household articles to those in the community.

It is built using the CodeIgniter PHP framework, a MySQL database to track transactions, and a CSS/XHTML user interface for recording donations, store transactions and calling up inventory reports.
